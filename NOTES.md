# FestPass notes

## Setup decisions
- pnpm workspaces: web/ and api/ share one install and one lockfile.
- TypeScript pinned to 5.9 (TypeScript 7 is too new for typescript-eslint and other tools).
- ESLint and Prettier are configured at the root. web/ gets Next.js's own ESLint config in Goal 4.
- API tsconfig uses NodeNext with no "type": "module", so imports need no .js endings.

## Design decisions
(add as you go)

## Load test numbers
(add in Goal 12)
